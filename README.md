# CSV-Analysis README
Overview
This repository contains a collection of scripts that demonstrate different ways to read and analyze CSV files, as well as perform basic data manipulation. The example provided here focuses on weather data and squirrel data analysis.

- Prerequisites
  Python 3.x
- Libraries:
    pandas
    csv (standard Python library)
  
# Steps:
The script reads the squirrel data from a CSV file.
It counts the number of squirrels by fur color (Gray, Cinnamon, Black).
Finally, it saves these counts into a new CSV file (squirrel_count.csv).

#File Descriptions:
=weather_data.csv: Example weather data used to demonstrate reading temperatures.
=2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Data.csv: Example squirrel data used for analysis based on fur color.
-squirrel_count.csv: The output file generated by the script that contains the squirrel color counts.


  Ways to Read and Analyze CSV Files
1. Using File I/O (Basic Approach)
The simplest method to read a CSV file is by using Python's built-in file handling.
2. Using the csv Module (Improved Approach)
The csv module offers more functionality, allowing us to parse the data more easily.
3. Using pandas (Advanced Approach)
The most efficient way to handle CSV data in Python is by using the pandas library, which provides extensive functionality for data analysis.

With pandas, you can:

Read a CSV file into a DataFrame.
Perform operations like filtering, aggregation, and more.
